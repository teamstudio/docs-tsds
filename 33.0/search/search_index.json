In addition to fixing a number of bugs, this release contains significant enhancements to the Teamstudio CIAO! features that assist in preparing templates for deployment, along with updates to all of the database templates (NTFs) used by the tools for reporting and configuration. This document describes these enhancements, along with a list of specific fixes. CIAO! Promotion Features Teamstudio CIAO! now includes new features to help ensure accurate, repeatable application builds. CIAO! has long offered a Promotion feature via the CIAO! Configuration database. This feature supports creating Promotion Paths for templates watched by CIAO! that define server and file locations where the template should be deployed. Promoting a template creates a copy of the template at the desired location, and also supports an optional Build Step to create a CIAO! version of the template automatically prior to the deployment. Edition 33 adds several new Build Steps to make it easy to prepare templates for deployment in a repeatable, consistent, and self-documenting manner \u2013 all with a single click. Similar to build systems for other types of software development, these new features help ensure each new version of a template is properly prepared for release without requiring a manual process or checklist. Significant new Build Steps include: Setting template properties such as Design Template Name and Title Defining the template ACL Changing element properties, such as clearing element-level design inheritance and Prohibit Design Refresh settings Compiling all LotusScript Signing the template with a specific ID Refreshing the design of target application(s) from the new template Detailed descriptions of the available functions are available from the Build Steps page. For more information on Promotions in general, see Promotion Paths . The new Build Steps represent a subset of the features available in Teamstudio Build Manager, which offers many additional capabilities to manage complex builds, including the ability to promote using different Notes IDs to support segregation of duties, Release Management/Deployment Tracking features, and Approval workflows. For a comparison of CIAO! and Build Manager, see Product Comparison - CIAO! and Build Manager . Upgrading CIAO! Configuration Database The updated Edition 33 CIAO! Configuration database is designed to continue working with existing Promotion Paths . A minor upgrade process is required, due to additional features added to the product. Prior versions of the CIAO! configuration database allowed free-form entry of the target server specified in the Promotion Path document, without any validation. The current version requires that target servers for promotion and design refresh actions be defined as Stored Servers , under the Resources tab in the configuration UI. Stored Server definitions can only be created by users with the [[Admin]] ACL role, and contain additional settings including defining which users are allowed to promote databases to the target server, and what other servers may be used as Design Refresh targets. For more information, see Stored Servers . To assist in the upgrade process, the CIAO! configuration now includes an agent available via Actions > Admin > Verify Stored Servers . This agent launches a wizard to scan Promotion Paths and Design Refresh steps and display the names of servers that have missing or disabled Stored Server definitions. Server names can be selected to automatically create Stored Server documents. Upgrading from a prior CIAO! template involves: Signing the new CIAO! Configuration and CIAO! Log templates with an appropriate Notes ID Refreshing the design of all CIAO! configuration and CIAO! log databases Running the Verify Stored Servers action to create server definitions as needed (only required if Promotion Paths are in use in prior version) For more information on the Verify Stored Servers action, see Stored Servers . Template Updates The Teamstudio Notes Tools utilize several Notes application templates for configuration and reporting. All templates have updated for Edition 33, including updated UI look and feel and new icons. Several templates also include usability improvements. Fix List 33.0.4 [TMS-1437] - Update code signing certificates to replace expiring certificates for the installer and Java plugins 33.0.3 [TMS-1286] - CIAO change report can fail to list all changes if Notes application has been moved [TMS-1302] - Installer does not detect Notes program locations on a clean Notes 11 install [TMS-1306] - The tools installer cannot uninstall if Notes has been moved or upgraded to a new location [TMS-1348] - Code copied from Configurator loses new lines when pasted into Notes [TMS-1366] - CIAO! configuration database should allow blank target filename in Promotion Path (to promote with source filename) [TMS-1380] - Analyzer always displays database percent usage as 0% [TMS-1381] - Analyzer displays database space allocated and space free incorrectly for databases > 4GB [TMS-1390] - Analyzer can crash evaluating formulas with large numbers of @if statements 33.0.2 [TMS-1266] - Delta crash running a report [TMS-1281] - Analyzer writes 'Filter error: Out of Memory' to the audit log for large minified documents [TMS-1300] - The message displayed for an expired key incorrectly refers to 'demonstration software' 33.0.1 [TMS-1247] - Update code signing certificates to replace expiring certificates for the installer and Java plugins [TMS-1249] - Fix Launch CIAO! action in CIAO!

Two types of CIAO! documents form the basis for building and promoting databases using CIAO!: Database Documents, also called CIAO! Configuration or \"Watch\" documents, define the \"source\" location - the source template of an application where development takes place. Promotion Paths define a \"target\" location - a server and path where the source template should be copied; build steps can then be run against this target to prepare it for release. Database Documents Configuration documents are created by CIAO! when a source database is placed under CIAO! control, as described in Using CIAO! For information on configuring database documents, see Understanding CIAO! Config Information . For promotions, CIAO! uses the Database Document to identify the source template which the build will copy and act on, and can be created: By choosing the CIAO! view menu button and choosing Add Database to add a source template that exists on a server. By launching the CIAO! client on a currently unwatched database, and following the prompts to begin watching the database. The second method will help ensure that all required fields are set accurately. Promotion Paths Promotion Paths specify a target location to \"promote\" a template. Promotion paths copy the source template to the target location, and run the child Build Steps against the new copy. Typically, a Promotion Path will include a child Build Step to refresh the design of one or more databases in the environment (e.g. QA, UAT, Production) where the template has been copied, or \"promoted.\" To create a Promotion Path, select the Database document that identifies the source template, and choose Create > Promotion Path . Build Steps Promotion Paths create or update a template in the target environment.

Client Edition Configurator Delta Design Manager Profiler Undo Validator You install client tools on each developer's workstation. If you are using them, you should first install the CIAO! and Profiler server components on a Notes/Domino server. See Install Server-based Modules for details. Windows Installer Beginning with Edition 32, the Notes Tools installer utilizes Windows Installer. This offers a more conventional installation experience than earlier versions and replaces the Widget Installers and the beta MSI installers from E31.1. Installation Verify that the system you are installing on meets the system requirements in the Before You Begin section. Download the Notes Tools installer from the Download Page . Close and exit all Notes client processes (Notes, Designer, Admin, etc.). Launch the downloaded \"Notes Tools.exe\" installer, and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. The installation wizard will allow you to confirm the location of the Notes client install, and choose which tools in the suite to install. The installation utilizes artifacts from the Notes client installation and can encounter issues if Notes has been moved or upgraded in certain ways. If you experience errors during installation, contact techsupport@teamstudio.com for guidance on how to resolve installation issues. Note If you previously installed a beta release with the same major and minor version number as the version you are installing, you must remove the existing install first, via the Windows Control Panel's \"Add or Remove Programs\" feature. If you installed the tools using the E31.1 beta MSI installers, we recommend removing the tools via the Windows Control Panel before installing E32. The E32 installer will upgrade your tools in any case, but it is not able to remove the old Control Panel entries. In all other cases, the E32 installer should be able to upgrade your existing installation. Installation Changes in E32 The tools are no longer installed using widgets. The installer will attempt to remove previous widgets as part of the upgrade process. The client tools are no longer installed to the Notes program directory. They are now installed, by default, to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Teamstudio\\Notes Tools\\bin and this directory is added to the current user's PATH. No files are installed to the Notes program directory. Note If you are upgrading from an older version of the tools, the E32 installer needs to remove any old Teamstudio files from the Notes program directory. If you are running Notes from a file server, you will need write access to that directory for the initial E32 install. Subsequent upgrades will no longer write to the Notes program directory. A single installer now handles the installation of all products. This means that all products from E32 onwards must be upgraded together. So when you upgrade to E32.1, for example, you cannot upgrade just Teamstudio Analyzer and leave Teamstudio Configurator at E32. This only applies to E32 and above - it is possible to retain, say, E31.1 of Teamstudio Analyzer and install E32 of Teamstudio Configurator. While rare, if you need to downgrade to an older version, you will need to uninstall all products and then reinstall the older version. It is no longer necessary to remove older versions before upgrading. The installer will automatically remove previous versions as part of the installation process. All installation directories are now configurable. The installer will attempt to find your Notes program directory, data directory and notes.ini location but you can modify them if you have a complex configuration that the installer does not correctly recognize. You can also change the directory in which the Teamstudio tools are installed, although this is not recommended.","title":"Installing on the Notes Client"},{"location":"install/client/#installing-on-the-notes-client","text":"","title":"Installing on the Notes Client"},{"location":"install/client/#introduction","text":"Client-based modules include: Analyzer CIAO!

A single installer now handles the installation of all products. This means that all products from E32 onwards must be upgraded together. So when you upgrade to E32.1, for example, you cannot upgrade just Teamstudio Analyzer and leave Teamstudio Configurator at E32. This only applies to E32 and above - it is possible to retain, say, E31.1 of Teamstudio Analyzer and install E32 of Teamstudio Configurator. While rare, if you need to downgrade to an older version, you will need to uninstall all products and then reinstall the older version. It is no longer necessary to remove older versions before upgrading. The installer will automatically remove previous versions as part of the installation process. All installation directories are now configurable. The installer will attempt to find your Notes program directory, data directory and notes.ini location but you can modify them if you have a complex configuration that the installer does not correctly recognize. You can also change the directory in which the Teamstudio tools are installed, although this is not recommended.","title":"Installation Changes in E32"},{"location":"install/icons/","text":"About Teamstudio Icons When Notes 8.0.x has restarted, you should see the Teamstudio SmartIcon(s) installed on your SmartIcon Toolbar.

In addition to fixing a number of bugs, this release contains significant enhancements to the Teamstudio CIAO! features that assist in preparing templates for deployment, along with updates to all of the database templates (NTFs) used by the tools for reporting and configuration. This document describes these enhancements, along with a list of specific fixes. CIAO! Promotion Features Teamstudio CIAO! now includes new features to help ensure accurate, repeatable application builds. CIAO! has long offered a Promotion feature via the CIAO! Configuration database. This feature supports creating Promotion Paths for templates watched by CIAO! that define server and file locations where the template should be deployed. Promoting a template creates a copy of the template at the desired location, and also supports an optional Build Step to create a CIAO! version of the template automatically prior to the deployment. Edition 33 adds several new Build Steps to make it easy to prepare templates for deployment in a repeatable, consistent, and self-documenting manner \u2013 all with a single click. Similar to build systems for other types of software development, these new features help ensure each new version of a template is properly prepared for release without requiring a manual process or checklist. Significant new Build Steps include: Setting template properties such as Design Template Name and Title Defining the template ACL Changing element properties, such as clearing element-level design inheritance and Prohibit Design Refresh settings Compiling all LotusScript Signing the template with a specific ID Refreshing the design of target application(s) from the new template Detailed descriptions of the available functions are available from the Build Steps page. For more information on Promotions in general, see Promotion Paths . The new Build Steps represent a subset of the features available in Teamstudio Build Manager, which offers many additional capabilities to manage complex builds, including the ability to promote using different Notes IDs to support segregation of duties, Release Management/Deployment Tracking features, and Approval workflows. For a comparison of CIAO! and Build Manager, see Product Comparison - CIAO! and Build Manager . Upgrading CIAO! Configuration Database The updated Edition 33 CIAO! Configuration database is designed to continue working with existing Promotion Paths . A minor upgrade process is required, due to additional features added to the product. Prior versions of the CIAO! configuration database allowed free-form entry of the target server specified in the Promotion Path document, without any validation. The current version requires that target servers for promotion and design refresh actions be defined as Stored Servers , under the Resources tab in the configuration UI. Stored Server definitions can only be created by users with the [[Admin]] ACL role, and contain additional settings including defining which users are allowed to promote databases to the target server, and what other servers may be used as Design Refresh targets. For more information, see Stored Servers . To assist in the upgrade process, the CIAO! configuration now includes an agent available via Actions > Admin > Verify Stored Servers . This agent launches a wizard to scan Promotion Paths and Design Refresh steps and display the names of servers that have missing or disabled Stored Server definitions. Server names can be selected to automatically create Stored Server documents. Upgrading from a prior CIAO! template involves: Signing the new CIAO! Configuration and CIAO! Log templates with an appropriate Notes ID Refreshing the design of all CIAO! configuration and CIAO! log databases Running the Verify Stored Servers action to create server definitions as needed (only required if Promotion Paths are in use in prior version) For more information on the Verify Stored Servers action, see Stored Servers . Template Updates The Teamstudio Notes Tools utilize several Notes application templates for configuration and reporting. All templates have updated for Edition 33, including updated UI look and feel and new icons. Several templates also include usability improvements.

Two types of CIAO! documents form the basis for building and promoting databases using CIAO!: Database Documents, also called CIAO! Configuration or \"Watch\" documents, define the \"source\" location - the source template of an application where development takes place. Promotion Paths define a \"target\" location - a server and path where the source template should be copied; build steps can then be run against this target to prepare it for release. Database Documents Configuration documents are created by CIAO! when a source database is placed under CIAO! control, as described in Using CIAO! For information on configuring database documents, see Understanding CIAO! Config Information . For promotions, CIAO! uses the Database Document to identify the source template which the build will copy and act on, and can be created: By choosing the CIAO! view menu button and choosing Add Database to add a source template that exists on a server. By launching the CIAO! client on a currently unwatched database, and following the prompts to begin watching the database. The second method will help ensure that all required fields are set accurately. Promotion Paths Promotion Paths specify a target location to \"promote\" a template. Promotion paths copy the source template to the target location, and run the child Build Steps against the new copy. Typically, a Promotion Path will include a child Build Step to refresh the design of one or more databases in the environment (e.g. QA, UAT, Production) where the template has been copied, or \"promoted.\" To create a Promotion Path, select the Database document that identifies the source template, and choose Create > Promotion Path . Build Steps Promotion Paths create or update a template in the target environment.

Windows Installer Beginning with Edition 32, the Notes Tools installer utilizes Windows Installer. This offers a more conventional installation experience than earlier versions and replaces the Widget Installers and the beta MSI installers from E31.1. Installation Verify that the system you are installing on meets the system requirements in the Before You Begin section. Download the Notes Tools installer from the Download Page . Close and exit all Notes client processes (Notes, Designer, Admin, etc.). Launch the downloaded \"Notes Tools.exe\" installer, and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. The installation wizard will allow you to confirm the location of the Notes client install, and choose which tools in the suite to install. The installation utilizes artifacts from the Notes client installation and can encounter issues if Notes has been moved or upgraded in certain ways. If you experience errors during installation, contact techsupport@teamstudio.com for guidance on how to resolve installation issues. Note If you previously installed a beta release with the same major and minor version number as the version you are installing, you must remove the existing install first, via the Windows Control Panel's \"Add or Remove Programs\" feature. If you installed the tools using the E31.1 beta MSI installers, we recommend removing the tools via the Windows Control Panel before installing E32. The E32 installer will upgrade your tools in any case, but it is not able to remove the old Control Panel entries. In all other cases, the E32 installer should be able to upgrade your existing installation. Installation Changes in E32 The tools are no longer installed using widgets. The installer will attempt to remove previous widgets as part of the upgrade process. The client tools are no longer installed to the Notes program directory. They are now installed, by default, to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Teamstudio\\Notes Tools\\bin and this directory is added to the current user's PATH. No files are installed to the Notes program directory. Note If you are upgrading from an older version of the tools, the E32 installer needs to remove any old Teamstudio files from the Notes program directory. If you are running Notes from a file server, you will need write access to that directory for the initial E32 install. Subsequent upgrades will no longer write to the Notes program directory. A single installer now handles the installation of all products. This means that all products from E32 onwards must be upgraded together. So when you upgrade to E32.1, for example, you cannot upgrade just Teamstudio Analyzer and leave Teamstudio Configurator at E32. This only applies to E32 and above - it is possible to retain, say, E31.1 of Teamstudio Analyzer and install E32 of Teamstudio Configurator. While rare, if you need to downgrade to an older version, you will need to uninstall all products and then reinstall the older version. It is no longer necessary to remove older versions before upgrading. The installer will automatically remove previous versions as part of the installation process. All installation directories are now configurable. The installer will attempt to find your Notes program directory, data directory and notes.ini location but you can modify them if you have a complex configuration that the installer does not correctly recognize. You can also change the directory in which the Teamstudio tools are installed, although this is not recommended.","title":"Installing on the Notes Client"},{"location":"ja/install/client/#installing-on-the-notes-client","text":"","title":"Installing on the Notes Client"},{"location":"ja/install/client/#introduction","text":"Client-based modules include: Analyzer CIAO!
