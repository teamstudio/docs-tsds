In addition to fixing a number of bugs, this release contains significant enhancements to the Teamstudio CIAO! features that assist in preparing templates for deployment, along with updates to all of the database templates (NTFs) used by the tools for reporting and configuration. This document describes these enhancements, along with a list of specific fixes. CIAO! Promotion Features Teamstudio CIAO! now includes new features to help ensure accurate, repeatable application builds. CIAO! has long offered a Promotion feature via the CIAO! Configuration database. This feature supports creating Promotion Paths for templates watched by CIAO! that define server and file locations where the template should be deployed. Promoting a template creates a copy of the template at the desired location, and also supports an optional Build Step to create a CIAO! version of the template automatically prior to the deployment. Edition 33 adds several new Build Steps to make it easy to prepare templates for deployment in a repeatable, consistent, and self-documenting manner \u2013 all with a single click. Similar to build systems for other types of software development, these new features help ensure each new version of a template is properly prepared for release without requiring a manual process or checklist. Significant new Build Steps include: Setting template properties such as Design Template Name and Title Defining the template ACL Changing element properties, such as clearing element-level design inheritance and Prohibit Design Refresh settings Compiling all LotusScript Signing the template with a specific ID Refreshing the design of target application(s) from the new template Detailed descriptions of the available functions are available from the Build Steps page. For more information on Promotions in general, see Promotion Paths . The new Build Steps represent a subset of the features available in Teamstudio Build Manager, which offers many additional capabilities to manage complex builds, including the ability to promote using different Notes IDs to support segregation of duties, Release Management/Deployment Tracking features, and Approval workflows. For a comparison of CIAO! and Build Manager, see Product Comparison - CIAO! and Build Manager . Upgrading CIAO! Configuration Database The updated Edition 33 CIAO! Configuration database is designed to continue working with existing Promotion Paths . A minor upgrade process is required, due to additional features added to the product. Prior versions of the CIAO! configuration database allowed free-form entry of the target server specified in the Promotion Path document, without any validation. The current version requires that target servers for promotion and design refresh actions be defined as Stored Servers , under the Resources tab in the configuration UI. Stored Server definitions can only be created by users with the [[Admin]] ACL role, and contain additional settings including defining which users are allowed to promote databases to the target server, and what other servers may be used as Design Refresh targets. For more information, see Stored Servers . To assist in the upgrade process, the CIAO! configuration now includes an agent available via Actions > Admin > Verify Stored Servers . This agent launches a wizard to scan Promotion Paths and Design Refresh steps and display the names of servers that have missing or disabled Stored Server definitions. Server names can be selected to automatically create Stored Server documents. Upgrading from a prior CIAO! template involves: Signing the new CIAO! Configuration and CIAO! Log templates with an appropriate Notes ID Refreshing the design of all CIAO! configuration and CIAO! log databases Running the Verify Stored Servers action to create server definitions as needed (only required if Promotion Paths are in use in prior version) For more information on the Verify Stored Servers action, see Stored Servers . Template Updates The Teamstudio Notes Tools utilize several Notes application templates for configuration and reporting. All templates have updated for Edition 33, including updated UI look and feel and new icons. Several templates also include usability improvements. Fix List 33.0.4 [TMS-1437] - Update code signing certificates to replace expiring certificates for the installer and Java plugins 33.0.3 [TMS-1286] - CIAO change report can fail to list all changes if Notes application has been moved [TMS-1302] - Installer does not detect Notes program locations on a clean Notes 11 install [TMS-1306] - The tools installer cannot uninstall if Notes has been moved or upgraded to a new location [TMS-1348] - Code copied from Configurator loses new lines when pasted into Notes [TMS-1366] - CIAO! configuration database should allow blank target filename in Promotion Path (to promote with source filename) [TMS-1380] - Analyzer always displays database percent usage as 0% [TMS-1381] - Analyzer displays database space allocated and space free incorrectly for databases > 4GB [TMS-1390] - Analyzer can crash evaluating formulas with large numbers of @if statements 33.0.2 [TMS-1266] - Delta crash running a report [TMS-1281] - Analyzer writes 'Filter error: Out of Memory' to the audit log for large minified documents [TMS-1300] - The message displayed for an expired key incorrectly refers to 'demonstration software' 33.0.1 [TMS-1247] - Update code signing certificates to replace expiring certificates for the installer and Java plugins [TMS-1249] - Fix Launch CIAO! action in CIAO!

Two types of CIAO! documents form the basis for building and promoting databases using CIAO!: Database Documents, also called CIAO! Configuration or \"Watch\" documents, define the \"source\" location - the source template of an application where development takes place. Promotion Paths define a \"target\" location - a server and path where the source template should be copied; build steps can then be run against this target to prepare it for release. Database Documents Configuration documents are created by CIAO! when a source database is placed under CIAO! control, as described in Using CIAO! For information on configuring database documents, see Understanding CIAO! Config Information . For promotions, CIAO! uses the Database Document to identify the source template which the build will copy and act on, and can be created: By choosing the CIAO! view menu button and choosing Add Database to add a source template that exists on a server. By launching the CIAO! client on a currently unwatched database, and following the prompts to begin watching the database. The second method will help ensure that all required fields are set accurately. Promotion Paths Promotion Paths specify a target location to \"promote\" a template. Promotion paths copy the source template to the target location, and run the child Build Steps against the new copy. Typically, a Promotion Path will include a child Build Step to refresh the design of one or more databases in the environment (e.g. QA, UAT, Production) where the template has been copied, or \"promoted.\" To create a Promotion Path, select the Database document that identifies the source template, and choose Create > Promotion Path . Build Steps Promotion Paths create or update a template in the target environment.

In addition to fixing a number of bugs, this release contains significant enhancements to the Teamstudio CIAO! features that assist in preparing templates for deployment, along with updates to all of the database templates (NTFs) used by the tools for reporting and configuration. This document describes these enhancements, along with a list of specific fixes.","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"ja/release/#ciao-promotion-features","text":"Teamstudio CIAO! now includes new features to help ensure accurate, repeatable application builds. CIAO! has long offered a Promotion feature via the CIAO! Configuration database. This feature supports creating Promotion Paths for templates watched by CIAO! that define server and file locations where the template should be deployed. Promoting a template creates a copy of the template at the desired location, and also supports an optional Build Step to create a CIAO! version of the template automatically prior to the deployment. Edition 33 adds several new Build Steps to make it easy to prepare templates for deployment in a repeatable, consistent, and self-documenting manner \u2013 all with a single click. Similar to build systems for other types of software development, these new features help ensure each new version of a template is properly prepared for release without requiring a manual process or checklist. Significant new Build Steps include: Setting template properties such as Design Template Name and Title Defining the template ACL Changing element properties, such as clearing element-level design inheritance and Prohibit Design Refresh settings Compiling all LotusScript Signing the template with a specific ID Refreshing the design of target application(s) from the new template Detailed descriptions of the available functions are available from the Build Steps page. For more information on Promotions in general, see Promotion Paths . The new Build Steps represent a subset of the features available in Teamstudio Build Manager, which offers many additional capabilities to manage complex builds, including the ability to promote using different Notes IDs to support segregation of duties, Release Management/Deployment Tracking features, and Approval workflows.

Promotion Features"},{"location":"ja/release/#upgrading-ciao-configuration-database","text":"The updated Edition 33 CIAO! Configuration database is designed to continue working with existing Promotion Paths . A minor upgrade process is required, due to additional features added to the product. Prior versions of the CIAO! configuration database allowed free-form entry of the target server specified in the Promotion Path document, without any validation. The current version requires that target servers for promotion and design refresh actions be defined as Stored Servers , under the Resources tab in the configuration UI. Stored Server definitions can only be created by users with the [[Admin]] ACL role, and contain additional settings including defining which users are allowed to promote databases to the target server, and what other servers may be used as Design Refresh targets. For more information, see Stored Servers . To assist in the upgrade process, the CIAO! configuration now includes an agent available via Actions > Admin > Verify Stored Servers .

Promotion Paths define a \"target\" location - a server and path where the source template should be copied; build steps can then be run against this target to prepare it for release. Database Documents Configuration documents are created by CIAO! when a source database is placed under CIAO! control, as described in Using CIAO! For information on configuring database documents, see Understanding CIAO! Config Information . For promotions, CIAO! uses the Database Document to identify the source template which the build will copy and act on, and can be created: By choosing the CIAO! view menu button and choosing Add Database to add a source template that exists on a server. By launching the CIAO! client on a currently unwatched database, and following the prompts to begin watching the database. The second method will help ensure that all required fields are set accurately. Promotion Paths Promotion Paths specify a target location to \"promote\" a template. Promotion paths copy the source template to the target location, and run the child Build Steps against the new copy.
