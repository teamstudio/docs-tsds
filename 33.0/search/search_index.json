In addition to fixing a number of bugs, this release contains significant enhancements to the Teamstudio CIAO! features that assist in preparing templates for deployment, along with updates to all of the database templates (NTFs) used by the tools for reporting and configuration. This document describes these enhancements, along with a list of specific fixes. CIAO! Promotion Features Teamstudio CIAO! now includes new features to help ensure accurate, repeatable application builds. CIAO! has long offered a Promotion feature via the CIAO! Configuration database. This feature supports creating Promotion Paths for templates watched by CIAO! that define server and file locations where the template should be deployed. Promoting a template creates a copy of the template at the desired location, and also supports an optional Build Step to create a CIAO! version of the template automatically prior to the deployment. Edition 33 adds several new Build Steps to make it easy to prepare templates for deployment in a repeatable, consistent, and self-documenting manner \u2013 all with a single click. Similar to build systems for other types of software development, these new features help ensure each new version of a template is properly prepared for release without requiring a manual process or checklist. Significant new Build Steps include: Setting template properties such as Design Template Name and Title Defining the template ACL Changing element properties, such as clearing element-level design inheritance and Prohibit Design Refresh settings Compiling all LotusScript Signing the template with a specific ID Refreshing the design of target application(s) from the new template Detailed descriptions of the available functions are available from the Build Steps page. For more information on Promotions in general, see Promotion Paths . The new Build Steps represent a subset of the features available in Teamstudio Build Manager, which offers many additional capabilities to manage complex builds, including the ability to promote using different Notes IDs to support segregation of duties, Release Management/Deployment Tracking features, and Approval workflows. For a comparison of CIAO! and Build Manager, see Product Comparison - CIAO! and Build Manager . Upgrading CIAO! Configuration Database The updated Edition 33 CIAO! Configuration database is designed to continue working with existing Promotion Paths . A minor upgrade process is required, due to additional features added to the product. Prior versions of the CIAO! configuration database allowed free-form entry of the target server specified in the Promotion Path document, without any validation. The current version requires that target servers for promotion and design refresh actions be defined as Stored Servers , under the Resources tab in the configuration UI. Stored Server definitions can only be created by users with the [[Admin]] ACL role, and contain additional settings including defining which users are allowed to promote databases to the target server, and what other servers may be used as Design Refresh targets. For more information, see Stored Servers . To assist in the upgrade process, the CIAO! configuration now includes an agent available via Actions > Admin > Verify Stored Servers . This agent launches a wizard to scan Promotion Paths and Design Refresh steps and display the names of servers that have missing or disabled Stored Server definitions. Server names can be selected to automatically create Stored Server documents. Upgrading from a prior CIAO! template involves: Signing the new CIAO! Configuration and CIAO! Log templates with an appropriate Notes ID Refreshing the design of all CIAO! configuration and CIAO! log databases Running the Verify Stored Servers action to create server definitions as needed (only required if Promotion Paths are in use in prior version) For more information on the Verify Stored Servers action, see Stored Servers . Template Updates The Teamstudio Notes Tools utilize several Notes application templates for configuration and reporting. All templates have updated for Edition 33, including updated UI look and feel and new icons. Several templates also include usability improvements. Fix List 33.0.4 [TMS-1437] - Update code signing certificates to replace expiring certificates for the installer and Java plugins 33.0.3 [TMS-1286] - CIAO change report can fail to list all changes if Notes application has been moved [TMS-1302] - Installer does not detect Notes program locations on a clean Notes 11 install [TMS-1306] - The tools installer cannot uninstall if Notes has been moved or upgraded to a new location [TMS-1348] - Code copied from Configurator loses new lines when pasted into Notes [TMS-1366] - CIAO! configuration database should allow blank target filename in Promotion Path (to promote with source filename) [TMS-1380] - Analyzer always displays database percent usage as 0% [TMS-1381] - Analyzer displays database space allocated and space free incorrectly for databases > 4GB [TMS-1390] - Analyzer can crash evaluating formulas with large numbers of @if statements 33.0.2 [TMS-1266] - Delta crash running a report [TMS-1281] - Analyzer writes 'Filter error: Out of Memory' to the audit log for large minified documents [TMS-1300] - The message displayed for an expired key incorrectly refers to 'demonstration software' 33.0.1 [TMS-1247] - Update code signing certificates to replace expiring certificates for the installer and Java plugins [TMS-1249] - Fix Launch CIAO! action in CIAO!

Sometimes, however, you must examine a combination of elements and their attributes to properly answer a question. The audit function can help by letting you define requirements and then test the design of the database or template to make sure it meets the requirements. Many of these requirements are reusable, such as standards or common coding errors. Others will have a unique temporary nature, such as a special change request or compatibility issues raised by upgrades to a new version of Notes.

Analyzer uses this template to create the analysis output database. The database stores the analysis documents for one or more Notes template or database designs. Note LotusScript, formula code, Java and JavaScript are always written as rich text. This is because plain text fields are limited to around 15K in size by the Notes client, and code can be as large as 64K. Since you cannot refer to rich text fields in view selection formula, this may at first seem limiting. You can create an agent which performs an @Abstract operation on the rich text, converting it to plain text, truncating it at some size less than 15K. For example: FIELD ScriptBegins := @If(fflpScripts=\"\";\"\";@Abstract([Save]:[Abbrev];14999;\"\";\"fflpScript\")) You can customize the template to create additional views or Notes agents. To create a template you can customize From Notes, make a new copy of the Teamstudio Analyzer Template ( ivesdean.ntf ). Open the Database Properties window for the new file. Then click the Design tab. From the Design tab, rename the new template. In the Database Categories box, enter DEANTemplate . When creating a new output database, you base its design on a template that you select from a list of all the templates you have created. You can add fields to the forms in the output database template. The fields can hold information, such as comments, that you add to the database. These additional fields are not overwritten when the analysis output is updated. Note The content of user-defined fields is only preserved between Analyzer runs for design notes and fields. Similarly, you can add forms to the output database template to hold any data you want to capture.

This is because plain text fields are limited to around 15K in size by the Notes client, and code can be as large as 64K.

Since most development organizations have their own standards and procedures, you may want to add your own filters, modify the severity to match terms and criteria you use, and classify filters with terms you normally use. With Auditor, it's easy to customize filters and their attributes to meet your organization's needs. You can find the filters and definitions of their attributes (class and severity) in the Analyzer Filter database. The Analyzer Filters database included in this release is deanfltr.ntf .

When you click Replace All , and your change causes an error, the original source code does not change. When you click Replace , and your change causes an error, Configurator gives you the option of saving the original source code or saving the source code with the error-causing changes. If you save an element with syntax errors, Configurator will not save the compiled (object) code for that element. Configurator only saves the object code from an error-free compile.

When you click Replace , and your change causes an error, Configurator gives you the option of saving the original source code or saving the source code with the error-causing changes. If you save an element with syntax errors, Configurator will not save the compiled (object) code for that element. Configurator only saves the object code from an error-free compile.

When Delta compares data documents in a view, it identifies corresponding data documents as those in the same position in the view. In Delta's main window, corresponding design elements or corresponding data documents display side-by-side in two panes. Design elements or documents in Database 1 display in the left pane and design elements or documents in Database 2 display in the right pane. The two panes are synchronized, so that as you scroll through design elements or documents in one pane, the content in the other pane scrolls with it, keeping corresponding items side-by-side. You click the plus/minus signs to expand/ collapse the content. Why Use Matching If two elements are of the same type, but their names have changed, Delta will not consider them corresponding and will not automatically list them side-by-side for comparison. Using Delta's Match feature, you can force the two elements to correspond so you can show the differences between the two. Delta matches documents that correspond to each other in a view. If a document's position in the view has changed between the two versions of the database you are comparing, Delta will not be able to automatically list them side-by-side for comparison. Similarly, two documents may be versions of each other, but if column sorting causes them to appear in different positions in the view, Delta will assume they are unrelated documents. Using Delta's Match feature, you can force the two documents to correspond so you can show the differences between the two. The two elements or documents you match remain matched until you exit Delta or you match them to something else. To match two elements Select an element title in one pane. Select the element title you want to match in the other pane. Right-click one of the two element titles. Choose Match from the shortcut menu.

Windows Installer Beginning with Edition 32, the Notes Tools installer utilizes Windows Installer. This offers a more conventional installation experience than earlier versions and replaces the Widget Installers and the beta MSI installers from E31.1. Installation Verify that the system you are installing on meets the system requirements in the Before You Begin section. Download the Notes Tools installer from the Download Page . Close and exit all Notes client processes (Notes, Designer, Admin, etc.). Launch the downloaded \"Notes Tools.exe\" installer, and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. The installation wizard will allow you to confirm the location of the Notes client install, and choose which tools in the suite to install. The installation utilizes artifacts from the Notes client installation and can encounter issues if Notes has been moved or upgraded in certain ways. If you experience errors during installation, contact techsupport@teamstudio.com for guidance on how to resolve installation issues. Note If you previously installed a beta release with the same major and minor version number as the version you are installing, you must remove the existing install first, via the Windows Control Panel's \"Add or Remove Programs\" feature. If you installed the tools using the E31.1 beta MSI installers, we recommend removing the tools via the Windows Control Panel before installing E32. The E32 installer will upgrade your tools in any case, but it is not able to remove the old Control Panel entries. In all other cases, the E32 installer should be able to upgrade your existing installation. Installation Changes in E32 The tools are no longer installed using widgets. The installer will attempt to remove previous widgets as part of the upgrade process. The client tools are no longer installed to the Notes program directory. They are now installed, by default, to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Teamstudio\\Notes Tools\\bin and this directory is added to the current user's PATH. No files are installed to the Notes program directory. Note If you are upgrading from an older version of the tools, the E32 installer needs to remove any old Teamstudio files from the Notes program directory. If you are running Notes from a file server, you will need write access to that directory for the initial E32 install. Subsequent upgrades will no longer write to the Notes program directory. A single installer now handles the installation of all products. This means that all products from E32 onwards must be upgraded together. So when you upgrade to E32.1, for example, you cannot upgrade just Teamstudio Analyzer and leave Teamstudio Configurator at E32. This only applies to E32 and above - it is possible to retain, say, E31.1 of Teamstudio Analyzer and install E32 of Teamstudio Configurator. While rare, if you need to downgrade to an older version, you will need to uninstall all products and then reinstall the older version. It is no longer necessary to remove older versions before upgrading. The installer will automatically remove previous versions as part of the installation process. All installation directories are now configurable. The installer will attempt to find your Notes program directory, data directory and notes.ini location but you can modify them if you have a complex configuration that the installer does not correctly recognize. You can also change the directory in which the Teamstudio tools are installed, although this is not recommended.","title":"Installing on the Notes Client"},{"location":"install/client/#installing-on-the-notes-client","text":"","title":"Installing on the Notes Client"},{"location":"install/client/#introduction","text":"Client-based modules include: Analyzer CIAO!

In addition to fixing a number of bugs, this release contains significant enhancements to the Teamstudio CIAO! features that assist in preparing templates for deployment, along with updates to all of the database templates (NTFs) used by the tools for reporting and configuration. This document describes these enhancements, along with a list of specific fixes. CIAO! Promotion Features Teamstudio CIAO! now includes new features to help ensure accurate, repeatable application builds. CIAO! has long offered a Promotion feature via the CIAO! Configuration database. This feature supports creating Promotion Paths for templates watched by CIAO! that define server and file locations where the template should be deployed. Promoting a template creates a copy of the template at the desired location, and also supports an optional Build Step to create a CIAO! version of the template automatically prior to the deployment. Edition 33 adds several new Build Steps to make it easy to prepare templates for deployment in a repeatable, consistent, and self-documenting manner \u2013 all with a single click. Similar to build systems for other types of software development, these new features help ensure each new version of a template is properly prepared for release without requiring a manual process or checklist. Significant new Build Steps include: Setting template properties such as Design Template Name and Title Defining the template ACL Changing element properties, such as clearing element-level design inheritance and Prohibit Design Refresh settings Compiling all LotusScript Signing the template with a specific ID Refreshing the design of target application(s) from the new template Detailed descriptions of the available functions are available from the Build Steps page. For more information on Promotions in general, see Promotion Paths . The new Build Steps represent a subset of the features available in Teamstudio Build Manager, which offers many additional capabilities to manage complex builds, including the ability to promote using different Notes IDs to support segregation of duties, Release Management/Deployment Tracking features, and Approval workflows. For a comparison of CIAO! and Build Manager, see Product Comparison - CIAO! and Build Manager . Upgrading CIAO! Configuration Database The updated Edition 33 CIAO! Configuration database is designed to continue working with existing Promotion Paths . A minor upgrade process is required, due to additional features added to the product. Prior versions of the CIAO! configuration database allowed free-form entry of the target server specified in the Promotion Path document, without any validation. The current version requires that target servers for promotion and design refresh actions be defined as Stored Servers , under the Resources tab in the configuration UI. Stored Server definitions can only be created by users with the [[Admin]] ACL role, and contain additional settings including defining which users are allowed to promote databases to the target server, and what other servers may be used as Design Refresh targets. For more information, see Stored Servers . To assist in the upgrade process, the CIAO! configuration now includes an agent available via Actions > Admin > Verify Stored Servers . This agent launches a wizard to scan Promotion Paths and Design Refresh steps and display the names of servers that have missing or disabled Stored Server definitions. Server names can be selected to automatically create Stored Server documents. Upgrading from a prior CIAO! template involves: Signing the new CIAO! Configuration and CIAO! Log templates with an appropriate Notes ID Refreshing the design of all CIAO! configuration and CIAO! log databases Running the Verify Stored Servers action to create server definitions as needed (only required if Promotion Paths are in use in prior version) For more information on the Verify Stored Servers action, see Stored Servers . Template Updates The Teamstudio Notes Tools utilize several Notes application templates for configuration and reporting. All templates have updated for Edition 33, including updated UI look and feel and new icons. Several templates also include usability improvements. Fix List 33.0.4 [TMS-1437] - Update code signing certificates to replace expiring certificates for the installer and Java plugins 33.0.3 [TMS-1286] - CIAO change report can fail to list all changes if Notes application has been moved [TMS-1302] - Installer does not detect Notes program locations on a clean Notes 11 install [TMS-1306] - The tools installer cannot uninstall if Notes has been moved or upgraded to a new location [TMS-1348] - Code copied from Configurator loses new lines when pasted into Notes [TMS-1366] - CIAO! configuration database should allow blank target filename in Promotion Path (to promote with source filename) [TMS-1380] - Analyzer always displays database percent usage as 0% [TMS-1381] - Analyzer displays database space allocated and space free incorrectly for databases > 4GB [TMS-1390] - Analyzer can crash evaluating formulas with large numbers of @if statements 33.0.2 [TMS-1266] - Delta crash running a report [TMS-1281] - Analyzer writes 'Filter error: Out of Memory' to the audit log for large minified documents [TMS-1300] - The message displayed for an expired key incorrectly refers to 'demonstration software' 33.0.1 [TMS-1247] - Update code signing certificates to replace expiring certificates for the installer and Java plugins [TMS-1249] - Fix Launch CIAO! action in CIAO!

This feature supports creating Promotion Paths for templates watched by CIAO! that define server and file locations where the template should be deployed. Promoting a template creates a copy of the template at the desired location, and also supports an optional Build Step to create a CIAO! version of the template automatically prior to the deployment. Edition 33 adds several new Build Steps to make it easy to prepare templates for deployment in a repeatable, consistent, and self-documenting manner \u2013 all with a single click. Similar to build systems for other types of software development, these new features help ensure each new version of a template is properly prepared for release without requiring a manual process or checklist. Significant new Build Steps include: Setting template properties such as Design Template Name and Title Defining the template ACL Changing element properties, such as clearing element-level design inheritance and Prohibit Design Refresh settings Compiling all LotusScript Signing the template with a specific ID Refreshing the design of target application(s) from the new template Detailed descriptions of the available functions are available from the Build Steps page. For more information on Promotions in general, see Promotion Paths . The new Build Steps represent a subset of the features available in Teamstudio Build Manager, which offers many additional capabilities to manage complex builds, including the ability to promote using different Notes IDs to support segregation of duties, Release Management/Deployment Tracking features, and Approval workflows. For a comparison of CIAO! and Build Manager, see Product Comparison - CIAO! and Build Manager .","title":"CIAO! Promotion Features"},{"location":"ja/release/#upgrading-ciao-configuration-database","text":"The updated Edition 33 CIAO! Configuration database is designed to continue working with existing Promotion Paths . A minor upgrade process is required, due to additional features added to the product. Prior versions of the CIAO! configuration database allowed free-form entry of the target server specified in the Promotion Path document, without any validation. The current version requires that target servers for promotion and design refresh actions be defined as Stored Servers , under the Resources tab in the configuration UI. Stored Server definitions can only be created by users with the [[Admin]] ACL role, and contain additional settings including defining which users are allowed to promote databases to the target server, and what other servers may be used as Design Refresh targets. For more information, see Stored Servers . To assist in the upgrade process, the CIAO! configuration now includes an agent available via Actions > Admin > Verify Stored Servers . This agent launches a wizard to scan Promotion Paths and Design Refresh steps and display the names of servers that have missing or disabled Stored Server definitions. Server names can be selected to automatically create Stored Server documents. Upgrading from a prior CIAO! template involves: Signing the new CIAO! Configuration and CIAO! Log templates with an appropriate Notes ID Refreshing the design of all CIAO! configuration and CIAO! log databases Running the Verify Stored Servers action to create server definitions as needed (only required if Promotion Paths are in use in prior version) For more information on the Verify Stored Servers action, see Stored Servers .","title":"Upgrading CIAO!

You define filters by specifying the attributes and properties that meet your criteria. Analyzer Filter Examples Use of @dblookup in a keyword definition (potential performance problem) Editable text fields without Help text (violations of organizational standards) Non-computed fields ending in \"_1\" (common coding errors) Existence of a certain design element (for example, Help Using, Help About or a particular form) Use of specific field properties (for example, Date/Time fields that don't display the year with four digits) Auditor scans the analysis output looking for design objects that match the filter criteria and documents each occurrence in the audit output database. Since most development organizations have their own standards and procedures, you may want to add your own filters, modify the severity to match terms and criteria you use, and classify filters with terms you normally use. With Auditor, it's easy to customize filters and their attributes to meet your organization's needs. You can find the filters and definitions of their attributes (class and severity) in the Analyzer Filter database. The Analyzer Filters database included in this release is deanfltr.ntf . Prior to Edition 24, it was deanfltr.nsf . This is so the install database does not overwrite the filter database currently on your system. If you have modified the database in any way, you will not lose any changes or customization. However, this means that you must create a new filter database if you want to incorporate the bug fixes included with this release. To upgrade your filters database Make a copy of your current Analyzer Filters Database ( deanfltr.nsf ) Create a new database ( File > Database > New ) and name it deanfltr.nsf Select Analyzer Filters Template from the template box. Click Yes when Notes asks if you want to overwrite the existing one. (It's OK; you made a copy) Copy all your custom filters into this new database from your old one. The attribute, Class, groups the same type of filters together. For example, filters that identify design techniques that can cause problems when you upgrade to a new Notes Release are typically categorized as Release \"A\" to Release \"B\" Upgrade Issues. Therefore, you can set up a class called Release A to Release B Upgrade or simply, Upgrade. Then, when you define a filter that fits this category, you assign it to the Upgrade class.

Since most development organizations have their own standards and procedures, you may want to add your own filters, modify the severity to match terms and criteria you use, and classify filters with terms you normally use. With Auditor, it's easy to customize filters and their attributes to meet your organization's needs. You can find the filters and definitions of their attributes (class and severity) in the Analyzer Filter database. The Analyzer Filters database included in this release is deanfltr.ntf . Prior to Edition 24, it was deanfltr.nsf . This is so the install database does not overwrite the filter database currently on your system. If you have modified the database in any way, you will not lose any changes or customization. However, this means that you must create a new filter database if you want to incorporate the bug fixes included with this release.","title":"Analyzer Filter Examples"},{"location":"ja/analyzer/filters/#to-upgrade-your-filters-database","text":"Make a copy of your current Analyzer Filters Database ( deanfltr.nsf ) Create a new database ( File > Database > New ) and name it deanfltr.nsf Select Analyzer Filters Template from the template box. Click Yes when Notes asks if you want to overwrite the existing one. (It's OK; you made a copy) Copy all your custom filters into this new database from your old one. The attribute, Class, groups the same type of filters together. For example, filters that identify design techniques that can cause problems when you upgrade to a new Notes Release are typically categorized as Release \"A\" to Release \"B\" Upgrade Issues. Therefore, you can set up a class called Release A to Release B Upgrade or simply, Upgrade. Then, when you define a filter that fits this category, you assign it to the Upgrade class. At run-time, you tell Auditor which class of filters to use.

When Delta compares data documents in a view, it identifies corresponding data documents as those in the same position in the view. In Delta's main window, corresponding design elements or corresponding data documents display side-by-side in two panes. Design elements or documents in Database 1 display in the left pane and design elements or documents in Database 2 display in the right pane. The two panes are synchronized, so that as you scroll through design elements or documents in one pane, the content in the other pane scrolls with it, keeping corresponding items side-by-side. You click the plus/minus signs to expand/ collapse the content. Why Use Matching If two elements are of the same type, but their names have changed, Delta will not consider them corresponding and will not automatically list them side-by-side for comparison. Using Delta's Match feature, you can force the two elements to correspond so you can show the differences between the two. Delta matches documents that correspond to each other in a view. If a document's position in the view has changed between the two versions of the database you are comparing, Delta will not be able to automatically list them side-by-side for comparison. Similarly, two documents may be versions of each other, but if column sorting causes them to appear in different positions in the view, Delta will assume they are unrelated documents. Using Delta's Match feature, you can force the two documents to correspond so you can show the differences between the two. The two elements or documents you match remain matched until you exit Delta or you match them to something else. To match two elements Select an element title in one pane. Select the element title you want to match in the other pane. Right-click one of the two element titles. Choose Match from the shortcut menu. Delta matches the two elements by redrawing the view with the elements you selected aligned. The matched element in the right pane will display without a name. You can now compare the differences between the two elements. See Viewing Differences for more information.

If you are using them, you should first install the CIAO! and Profiler server components on a Notes/Domino server. See Install Server-based Modules for details. Windows Installer Beginning with Edition 32, the Notes Tools installer utilizes Windows Installer. This offers a more conventional installation experience than earlier versions and replaces the Widget Installers and the beta MSI installers from E31.1. Installation Verify that the system you are installing on meets the system requirements in the Before You Begin section. Download the Notes Tools installer from the Download Page . Close and exit all Notes client processes (Notes, Designer, Admin, etc.). Launch the downloaded \"Notes Tools.exe\" installer, and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. The installation wizard will allow you to confirm the location of the Notes client install, and choose which tools in the suite to install. The installation utilizes artifacts from the Notes client installation and can encounter issues if Notes has been moved or upgraded in certain ways. If you experience errors during installation, contact techsupport@teamstudio.com for guidance on how to resolve installation issues. Note If you previously installed a beta release with the same major and minor version number as the version you are installing, you must remove the existing install first, via the Windows Control Panel's \"Add or Remove Programs\" feature. If you installed the tools using the E31.1 beta MSI installers, we recommend removing the tools via the Windows Control Panel before installing E32. The E32 installer will upgrade your tools in any case, but it is not able to remove the old Control Panel entries. In all other cases, the E32 installer should be able to upgrade your existing installation. Installation Changes in E32 The tools are no longer installed using widgets. The installer will attempt to remove previous widgets as part of the upgrade process. The client tools are no longer installed to the Notes program directory. They are now installed, by default, to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Teamstudio\\Notes Tools\\bin and this directory is added to the current user's PATH. No files are installed to the Notes program directory. Note If you are upgrading from an older version of the tools, the E32 installer needs to remove any old Teamstudio files from the Notes program directory. If you are running Notes from a file server, you will need write access to that directory for the initial E32 install. Subsequent upgrades will no longer write to the Notes program directory. A single installer now handles the installation of all products. This means that all products from E32 onwards must be upgraded together. So when you upgrade to E32.1, for example, you cannot upgrade just Teamstudio Analyzer and leave Teamstudio Configurator at E32. This only applies to E32 and above - it is possible to retain, say, E31.1 of Teamstudio Analyzer and install E32 of Teamstudio Configurator. While rare, if you need to downgrade to an older version, you will need to uninstall all products and then reinstall the older version. It is no longer necessary to remove older versions before upgrading. The installer will automatically remove previous versions as part of the installation process. All installation directories are now configurable. The installer will attempt to find your Notes program directory, data directory and notes.ini location but you can modify them if you have a complex configuration that the installer does not correctly recognize. You can also change the directory in which the Teamstudio tools are installed, although this is not recommended.","title":"Installing on the Notes Client"},{"location":"ja/install/client/#installing-on-the-notes-client","text":"","title":"Installing on the Notes Client"},{"location":"ja/install/client/#introduction","text":"Client-based modules include: Analyzer CIAO!
