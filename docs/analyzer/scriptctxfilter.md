# Context Filter

You use a context filter to specify the design categories to be analyzed, for example Forms or Shared Actions. You cannot use context filters to specify particular elements within a category; all elements within the category will be processed.

The following table defines the syntax to use for each category when you define the context filter parameter in a script call. For example, to analyze only the Forms, Subforms and Folders in a database, you would enter "**-fm-sf-fl**". The string is not case-sensitive.
