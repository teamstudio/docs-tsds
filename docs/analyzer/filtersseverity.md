# Editing or Creating Severity Definitions

The Audit database includes pre-defined severity levels that are assigned to each filter. Auditor displays data in descending sort order for severity sequence. The higher the numeric value, the more important it is to address the issue causing the data element's selection. You can assign severity levels in any numerical range, including negative numbers.
