## To configure a simple data document report

2. Click the **CD Records** container type in the left list box to display all of its CD Records in the right list box.
3. Click **Hide All** to clear any selections for CD Records. Selections for other container types are not affected.
4. Select the following CD records from the CD Records container:
    * Text
    * Field
    * Keyword
    * Ext Field
    * Ext2 Field
