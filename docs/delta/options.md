# Delta Options

You use the check boxes in the lower left corner of the main window to filter the comparison results:

| <div style="width:150px">Check box</div> | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Hide identical objects](img/options.png) | Select **Hide Identical Objects** (the default) to list only elements and documents that are different in the two panes. Clear this check box to see the complete database designâ€” elements and documents that are identical and elements and documents that are different. |
| ![Smart Filter](img/options2.png) | Select **Smart Filter** to hide or filter information that is of no practical interest when comparing the database designs.<br>For example, an Agent stores information about the last time it was run. This is likely to be different between two different copies of a database, but does not really mean that there are differences in the design. With **Smart Filter** selected, Delta ignores that attribute. |
| ![Hide unique notes](img/options3.png) | Select **Hide Unique Notes** to hide notes that exist in only one of the databases you are comparing. |
