# How Delta Works

Teamstudio Delta compares two database designs and shows you what is different between them. If you ran Delta against an earlier Notes release e-mail template and the later Notes release e-mail template, you would quickly discover a number of changes.

Without the help of Delta, finding these changes would take hours.

Delta makes it easy to compare visual elements, such as two forms. You can examine two forms, and instead of seeing the code in text form, you see a visual representation of each design element, side-by-side. As you scroll left, right, up, and down, the two preview panes stay in sync making it easy to compare the two forms.
