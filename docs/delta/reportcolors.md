# About Difference Report Fonts and Colors

You use options on the Appearance tab to specify how Delta indicates differences in the report. By default, Delta uses the Helv font as follows:

| Text Color | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Black | Corresponding lines of text in both databases are identical. |
| <span style="color:red">Red</span> | <span style="color:red">Corresponding lines of text in both databases are different.</span> |
| <span style="color:green">Green</span> | <span style="color:green">Line of text appears in Database 1 (on left) but not in Database 2.</span> |
| <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> | <span style="color:blue">Line of text appears in Database 2 (on right) but not in Database 1.</span> |

You can change these default typefaces and colors on the **Appearance** tab.
