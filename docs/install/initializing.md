# Initializing Teamstudio Tools

Each Teamstudio client product is protected by a serial number and key. You must configure each Teamstudio client product before you can use it. You will receive a serial number and key pair with each Teamstudio client license that you purchase.

## To initialize Teamstudio client products
1. From Designer, click the icon for the tool you want to initialize.
2. You see a Serial Number dialog.
3. Enter the serial number (in this format xx-xxxxx) and key for the product (in this format xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx).  
   You are prompted for this information once for each product, the first time you run the product.
4. Click **OK**.  
The Teamstudio product you selected starts immediately.

If you cannot remember the serial number and key, or do not have the information on hand, please contact Teamstudio.

If you are prompted for the information again after entering it, you likely entered an incorrect serial number or key. Review, confirm, and re-enter the serial number and key. If the system does not start, contact Teamstudio.
