| nconfy.exe | Configurator |
| ndelta.exe | Delta |

You can start the products

* From the Microsoft Windows Command prompt.
* From a new shortcut you create on your desktop.
For example, to launch CIAO! on a particular database, specify in a command line:
```

```

where `database` is one of `Server/Domain!!database`, `Server!!database` or `database`.
