# Matching Case

<figure markdown="1">

If the **Case** check box is selected, a string will only match if the case of the two strings matches.

For example, without the **Case** check box selected, replacing the string "Customer" with the string "Client" would have the following results:
<table>
  <tr><td>"Customer"</td><td>would be changed to</td><td>"Client"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>"customer"</td><td>would be changed to</td><td>"Client"</td></tr>
</table>

With the **Case** check box selected, the same search/replace operation would have the following results:
<table>
  <tr><td>"Customer"</td><td>would be changed to</td><td>"Client"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>"customer"</td><td>would remain as</td><td>"customer"</td></tr>
</table>
