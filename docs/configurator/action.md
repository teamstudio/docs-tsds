# Telling Configurator What Action to Take

Once you have selected the options, you are ready to select the Action, that is, what Configurator is actually going to do.

The actions are:

* Find
* Find All
* Replace All
 
## Find
Click the Find button to locate the first occurrence of the search string in the database. Once Configurator finds a match, you can do one of the following:

* Replace that match and move on to the next match
* Skip that match and move on to the next match
* Replace that match and all subsequent matches
* Cancel out of the operation

See [When Configurator Finds a Match](match.md) for more information.

## Find All
Click the Find All button to have Configurator locate all instances of the search match. While the process is running, you can interrupt it by pressing the CTRL key while simultaneously pressing the BREAK key (CTRL-BREAK) on your keyboard. When the search is finished, you see the Configurator Log, detailing the following:

* Number of notes searched
* Number of matches per element
* Total number of matches found

Configurator makes no replacements when you use Find All.

## Replace All
Click the Replace All button to have Configurator replace all search matches with no prompting. While the process is running, you can interrupt it by pressing the CTRL key while simultaneously pressing the BREAK key (CTRL-BREAK) on your keyboard.

!!! note
    Clicking Replace All will replace all text without prompting.
