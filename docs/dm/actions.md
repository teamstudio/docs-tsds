# Organizing Actions in a Library

As you organize a library, you can make actions shared or unshared, copy actions, and change the location of actions on the action bar.

## Making Actions Shared or Unshared
You can make an action shared or unshared as follows:

### To make an action shared or unshared
* From the right-click menu, select the Make action(s) Shared command to convert a regular action into a shared action.
* This menu command is context-sensitive. If the action is already shared, select the Unshare Action(s) command from the right-click menu to convert the action into a regular action.

## Moving Actions on the Action Bar
Use the right-click menu and select **Move Action Up** or **Move Action Down** to change the order in which actions appear on the action bar. Use **Move Action Up** to move an action to the left on the Action Bar. Use **Move Action Down** to move an action to the right on the Action Bar.
 
!!! note
    Shared actions cannot be moved up or down.
