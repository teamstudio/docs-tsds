# Opening Used Libraries

When you open used libraries, it is easier to find the library you may need for a design refresh.

To open all libraries that a database design inherits from, select at least one database in the right pane and then choose **Open Used Libraries** from the **Database** menu. Design Manager then prompts you for a server to search. Design Manager displays a list of matching templates in the left pane. 

## To identify and open all the libraries used by a particular database design
1. Select at least one database in the right pane.
2. From the **Database** menu, choose **Open Used Libraries**
3. From the **Server** dropdown, select the server you want to search, then click **OK**.
