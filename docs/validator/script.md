# Script Overview

You can perform some Validator operations from LotusScript. Use the ValidatorUtil script library which is included in the Teamstudio Reports template (**tmslogs.ntf**) to set up a report to be run in batch.

This section provides detailed descriptions of each ValidatorUtil script library function, followed by agent examples that illustrate how to use it.

The ValidatorUtil script library exposes the following functions:

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [LINKGenerateReport](scriptgeneratereport.md) | Examine all the documents in a database and product a report. |
| [LINKStringLoad](scriptstringload.md) | Obtains the error message associated with an error code returned from the other APIs. |
