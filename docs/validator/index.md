# Overview

Teamstudio Validator lets you report on areas within your database documents that no longer function correctly. Use this tool during the upgrades of an existing application where design changes have occurred and you want to determine where existing documents in the database no longer work as expected.

Validator reports on static links that no longer function by checking the target of both Notes document links and standard URL links. Validator reports on fields that no longer exist on the form/subform design, but still exist on documents.

Validator also checks keyword fields to ensure that values stored in the document still agree with values in the field design. Validator reports on orphaned documents.

Validator lets you create detailed reports including:

* Errors
* Error descriptions
* Document links to the actual document
