# CIAO! Version Control

With CIAO!, you can store previous versions of design elements and you can restore them if needed. Each time you check in a new version of a design element, you may enter a comment about and identify an issue related to the changes you made. CIAO! keeps a log of all the changes to each design element, so you can rollback to any stored version of the design element you want.

When viewing a design element's change history, you can compare two versions of the element, so you can see exactly what has changed from one version to the next.

When the design of a database is ready for release, you can make a new version. When you make a version, CIAO! assigns all of the design elements the same date and comment, and stores a copy of the database design in the log database.
