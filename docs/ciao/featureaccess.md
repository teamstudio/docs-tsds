# Assigning CIAO! Feature Access

You can prevent unauthorized access to CIAO! features such as Make Version and Grab through the CIAO! Configuration database.

# To assign access
1. From the CIAO! Config database, open the database configuration document for editing.
2. Click the **Authority** tab.  
  You see the **CIAO! Authority** window.

3. Set the access authority for the action you want to assign. In each case, you see the **Select Names** window.  
   We recommend that you choose from an address book to which everyone has access. Otherwise, some people may be locked out because CIAO! cannot resolve the names specified.
