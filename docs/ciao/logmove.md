# Moving a Database's History

## To move a database's history to a different log database
You can move the history of a database under CIAO! control to a different log database as follows:

1. Create a new log database.
2. Cut and paste the history documents for this database from the current log database into the new one.
3. In the CIAO! configuration database, edit the values of the Log Server and Log Path fields to point to the new log database.
