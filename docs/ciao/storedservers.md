# Stored Servers

You must define a list of servers to which you want to promote databases. From a stored server document you can also predefine who can promote to each of those servers. This improves security by separating server access authority from the authority to create an action.

Stored servers may either be specified manually or imported from the DominoÂ® Directory

## To Import Servers
1. From the Resources tab, choose Resources > Stored Servers.
2. Click the Import Servers action button.
3. Click Browse and specify the address book to use.

## The Verify Stored Servers action
To ensure that all the servers required for **Promotions** are defined and enabled, run **Actions > Admin > Verify Stored Servers**. This agent launches a wizard to scan **Promotion Paths** and **Design Refresh** steps, and display the names of server that have missing or disabled **Stored Server** definitions. Server names can be selected to automatically create or enable **Stored Server** documents.

**Stored Servers** created by this action will use the server name for both the **Server Name** and **Description** field. No **Promotion Authority** entries will be added, allowing any user to promote to this server. The **Allowed Refresh Servers** field will be left blank, allowing refresh of databases only on the same server.
