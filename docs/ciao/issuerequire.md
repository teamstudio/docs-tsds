# Requiring an Issue to Check In/Out

At the bottom of the CIAO! Database Configuration page there are two checkboxes:

* An Issue is Required When Checking In
* An issue is Required When Checking Out

When you check either of these options, CIAO! requires you to select an issue to associate with your check-in or check-out. You can select from a list based on a formula or based on a view in the issue database.
