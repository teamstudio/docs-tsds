# Project Builds

A Project Build specifies multiple [Promotion Paths](promotionpaths.md) and allows them to be run in order, with a single click.

To create a project build, navigate to the **Paths > Project Builds** view:

Click **New Project Build** to create a Project Build:
<figure markdown="1">
  ![New Project Build](img/promotionproject2.png)
</figure>
 
Set the **Description** field, and click **Add** to select the **Promotion Paths** the Project Build should include.  Order the Promotion Paths in the order they should run. Optionally, select **Continue with next promotion after failure** if additional promotions should continue to run after one of the promotions fails. Save the Project Build.
 
To run a Project Build, select the promotion in the Project Builds view, and click **Promote**. The promotions run serially in the order specified. A log is created for the overall Project Build, and a separate log is created for each specific Promotion Path, and can be viewed in the Logs views:
