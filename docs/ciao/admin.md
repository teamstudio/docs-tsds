# About CIAO! Client and Server

There are two components of CIAO!. The CIAO! Client Edition is installed on each developer's workstation, and allows an individual developer to participate in check- in, check-out and versioning. CIAO! Client's security features can prevent unauthorized access to the configuration database and to CIAO! features such as Make Version and Grab.

You can optionally install Teamstudio CIAO! Server Edition onto each Domino server used in the development process. CIAO! Server Edition ensures that only users running CIAO! Client Edition who have the appropriate design element(s) checked out can make design changes. Teamstudio CIAO! Server Edition provides an optional, added level of security beyond using Teamstudio CIAO! Client Edition alone.
